# Whisperer

**Whisperer** is a **fast, minimalist translation assistant** that helps you stay focused by translating selected text without jumping through windows.

### ‚úÖ What it does:

- Listens for a global keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + L`)
- Reads the currently selected text
- Translates the text from English to Polish via the [Lingva Translate API](https://github.com/TheDavidDelta/lingva-translate)
- Displays the translation in a temporary popup overlay
- All of this happens without stealing window focus or interrupting your workflow

### üß© Architecture Overview

| Component         | Responsibility                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.cpp`        | Program entry point; instantiates and runs `Whisperer`                         |
| `Whisperer`       | Main orchestrator: wires together the listener, translator, and popup          |
| `Listener`        | Interface for detecting keyboard shortcuts (platform-specific implementations) |
| `Translator`      | Translates input using an abstract API                                         |
| `TranslationAPI`  | Interface for translation services; `LingvaAPI` is the current implementation  |
| `Popup`           | Interface for displaying translation overlays (OS-specific implementations)    |
| `ClipboardReader` | Abstracts access to selected or clipboard text                                 |
| `InputDevice`     | Linux-specific interface to listen for raw input events                        |

All platform-specific logic is abstracted behind interfaces (e.g., `LinuxListener`, `WindowsPopup`) to ensure maintainable cross-platform support.
